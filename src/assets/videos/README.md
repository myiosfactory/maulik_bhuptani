Place your project video files in this folder with the following filenames so the portfolio references work:

- DragonAI.mp4
- GolfAI.mp4

If you have different filenames, update `src/portfolio.js` to point to the correct paths.

These files are not included in the repo by default — add them manually (they can be large).
